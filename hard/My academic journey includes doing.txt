My academic journey includes doing a short-semester project on  Heart Disease Detection Web App using Flask, Chest Disease Detection and conducting sentiment analysis on the Israel-Palestine war using BERT. Additionally, I am developing a Kashmiri language machine translation system to address linguistic challenges in low-resource NLP, showcasing my adaptability and problem-solving skills. My technical expertise includes Python and ML libraries, several front-end and back-end technologies validated through projects like an Automated Intrusion Detection System and certifications in deep learning deployment which are coming along by December 2024
